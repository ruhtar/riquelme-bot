# Riquelme - Discord Bot

## Description

This Discord bot is a joke made by me to mess around with some friends, but also trying to deliver some cool features. It is built using TypeScript, Node.js, and Discord.js. It includes several features aimed at enhancing our Discord server's functionality, including static command statistics tracking and monitoring user call time. 

## Features

- **Static Command Statistics**: Keep track of how many times each command has been used.
- **User Call Time Monitoring**: Monitor the amount of time a user spends in voice calls.
- **Monthly reports**: Riquelme will post a report every month of the most active users on the server and also the least active ones. Riquelme will also post the list of the most/least used commands of the month.
